# Retrospeculative

Searching for a connection between early ideas of technology in science fiction literature and the technological products that are in use today.

## What it is

We’re starting out building a repository of artefacts (markdown files) that show a connection between an early idea and the actual implementation of a technological product. We call these type of artefacts [*retrospect*](/retrospect/) and are accessible using the similarly named menu item. 

During class we will dig into early ideas of future technology in modern day science fiction literature and try create scenario’s and prototype interfaces that could become the implementation of these idea’s. We’ll call these type of artefacts [*prospect*](/prospect/), these are also accessible using the appropriately named menu item.

## What it isn’t

Although the idea of a large library of ultrafancy images or a collection of science fiction ideas is tempting it is not the purpose of this repository. There are a lot of [blogrolls](http://sciencefictioninterfaces.tumblr.com/), [articles](https://www.glow-internet.com/infographics/50-years-of-visionary-scifi-computer-interface-designs/) and [websites](http://www.technovelgy.com/) dedicated to these specific quests. As much as we like collecting [science fiction interfaces](https://www.noteloop.com/kit/fui/) and the study of [interaction design](https://scifiinterfaces.com/) patterns behind it, there are people already doing that. Of course there might be some overlap here and there, but only if it serves the [purpose of our project](#what-it-is).

## Care to join?

Never enough artefacts! If you want to dedicate some time prospecting, why not join in on creating the [largest retrospeculative repository of artefacts](https://github.com/ju5tu5/retrospeculative) to date.
