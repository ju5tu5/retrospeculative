# Video Calling

A device that carries both voice and image, letting two parties see and communicate with each other.

These days everybody uses video calling using a plethora of services like Skype, Hangouts, FaceTime among others.

Of course telegraphy has been in development since 1729 and became commercial around 1837 and telephone has been in development since the ~1850’s. 

## Modern implementation

The following passage from *The machine stops* describes a clear idea of video calling and the interface that comes along with it. The interface is mostly about bells, switches and knobs. The bell gives a signal that someone is trying to call, a switch turns off the music and an [isolation knob]() shuts out other incoming transmissions. The screen on what i think is a round [tablet computer]() is not too bright so the *lighting apparatus* must be turned off as well using a [touch interface]().

> An electric bell rang.
> 
> The woman touched a switch and the music was silent.
> 
> “I suppose I must see who it is", she thought, and set her chair in motion. The chair, like the music, was worked by machinery and it rolled her to the other side of the room where the bell still rang importunately.
> 
> “Who is it?" she called. Her voice was irritable, for she had been interrupted often since the music began. She knew several thousand people, in certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously.
> 
> But when she listened into the receiver, her white face wrinkled into smiles, and she said:
> 
> ”Very well. Let us talk, I will isolate myself. I do not expect anything important will happen for the next five minutes-for I can give you fully five minutes, Kuno. Then I must deliver my lecture on “Music during the Australian Period”."
> 
> She touched the isolation knob, so that no one else could speak to her. Then she touched the lighting apparatus, and the little room was plunged into darkness.
> 
> “Be quick!" She called, her irritation returning. "Be quick, Kuno; here I am in the dark wasting my time."
> 
> But it was fully fifteen seconds before the round plate that she held in her hands began to glow. A faint blue light shot across it, darkening to purple, and presently she could see the image of her son, who lived on the other side of the earth, and he could see her.
